                    Hi, I'm Ben, nice to meet you.  I recently enrolled in a coder boot camp at the University of Minnesota and have begun learning the skills needed to create and design web pages, something I have wanted to learn for a long time.  I am very excited about this opportunity.
                    I'm hoping for a career change to something much more fulfilling and meaningful than my current job at MnDot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I am not working, I enjoy many things:  biking, hiking, camping, skiing, world travel, basketball, golf, finding new music, weightlifting and exercise, watching shows on Netflix, and having fun with my 2 cats, IV and Lynx.  Most importantly though, I enjoy spending time and doing activities with my wife.                  
                </p>

                <p>
                    My wife and I have been on some great adventures over the past 5 years when we first met.  Our first vacation together was a trip to Zion National Park in Utah.  We also visited The Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon National Park on that trip.  The hikes and views were incredible!  
                    Two years ago we journeyed across the US to Seattle, Washington.  We camped and hiked at Glacier National Park for 2 nights on the way.  After a week in Seattle we joined some of our family members for a cruise to Alaska.  We saw whales, bears, hundreds of bald eagles, and even hiked on a glacier.  
                    Last summer was the trip of a lifetime though.  With my father-in-law joining us, we visited Tanzania for a 2 week safari.  I've been an animal lover my whole life so this trip was very special.  We camped in Tarangire National Park, Serengeti National Park, and right next to the Ngorongoro Crater.  
                    The animals were incredible.  Lions, cheetahs, leopards, hippos, elephants and tons more!
